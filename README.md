## Shopping Cart
The Shopping Cart project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. 


## About
- This project is built using React. 

- To begin your shopping, go to the 'Shop' page either by clicking on the 'Shop Now' button on the Home page, or clicking the Shop link in the navigation bar. 

- When on the Shop page, click on the 'Add To Cart' button. To access your items in the cart, you need to click on the handbag button. Once you click the handbag button, the items you selected will be shown. 

- You can increase or decrease the quantity of the items. To remove the item, keep clicking the decrease button. When it gets to zero, it will be removed.

- Once you're done shopping, click on the Checkout button. When clicking on the Checkout button, you will be redirected to the Checkout page which will display a fictitious order number that I created using the Math.Random() method. Then, after 2 seconds, the page will be freshed and the items in your cart will be cleared.
